# ☁️ Day 4: SkyCast Weather Dashboard
### Part of the 7-Day Web Dev Project Challenge

A sleek, real-time weather application that fetches global weather data and dynamically updates the UI based on environmental conditions.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Live Data Fetching:** Integrated with the OpenWeatherMap REST API.
- **Dynamic Iconography:** Weather icons change automatically based on the 'weather condition' ID.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Custom logic to catch 401 (Unauthorized) and 404 (City Not Found) errors without crashing the UI.
- **Unit Transformation:** Converts Kelvin to Celsius and formats wind speed metrics.

## 🛠️ Technical Gains
- **Conditional Rendering:** Using `display: none` and `block` to manage loading and error states.
- **API Security:** Understanding how to handle API keys and the importance of Environment Variables.
- **String Manipulation:** Building complex query URLs using Template Literals.
